# Problem Set 3

## Hangman Game



### Introduction

For this problem, you wil implement a variation of the classic word game Hangman. In this problem, the second player will always be the computer, who will be picking a word at random.

In this problem, you will implement a **function**, called `hangman`, that will start up and carry out an interactive Hangman game between a player and the computer. Before we get to this function, we'll first implement a few helper functions to get you going.



For this problem, you will need the code files <u>ps_hangman.py</u> and <u>words.txt</u>. Be sure to save the files in the same directory. Open and run the file without making any modifications to it, in order to ensure that everything is set up correctly.



The program should print out:

```python
Loading word list from file...
55909 words loaded.
```

If you see an `IOError` instead (e.g. "No such file or directory"), you should change the value of the WORDLIST_FLIENAME constant (defined near the top of the file) to the complete pathname for the file words.txt (This will vary based on where you saved the file)

`WORDLIST_FILENAME = "words.txt"`Â  to something like

`WORDLIST_FILENAME = "C:/Users/Ana/words.txt"`



This folder will vary depending on where you saved the files.

The files ps3_hangman.py has a numbere of already implemented functions you can use while writing up your solution. You can ignore the code between the following comments, through you should read and understand how to use each helper function by reading the docstrings:

```python
# -----------------------------------
# Helper code
# You don't need to understand this helper code,
# but you will have to know how to use the functions
# (so be sure to read the docstrings!)
    .
    .
    .
# (end of helper code)
# -----------------------------------
```

You will want to do all of your coding for this problem within this file as well becuase you will be writing a program that depends on each function your write.



### Requirements

Here are the requirements for your game:

1. The computer must select a word at random from the list of available words that was provided in words.txt.
   The functions for loading the word list and selecting a random word have already been provided for you in ps3_hangman.py
2. The game must be interactive; the flow of the game should go as follows:
- At the start of the game, let the user know how many letters the computer's word contains.
- Ask the user to supply one guess (i.e. letter) per round.
- The user should receive feedback immediately after each guess about whether their guess appears in the computer's word.
- After each round, you should also display to the user the partially guessed word so far, as well as letters that the user has not yet guessed.
3. Some additional rules of the game:
- A user is allowed 8 guesses. Make sure to remind the user of how many guesses he/she has left after each round. Assume that players will only ever submit one character at a time (A-Z)
- A user loses a guess only when s/he guesses incorrectly.
- If the user guesses the same letter twice, do not take away a guess - instead, print a message letting them know they've already guessed that letter and ask them to try again.
- The game should end when the user constructs the full word or runs out of guesses. If the player runs out of guesses (they lose), reveal the word to the user when the game ends.

```

### Problem 1 - Is the Word Guessed

We'll start by writing 3 simple functions that will help us easily code the Hangman problem. 

First, implement the function `isWordGuessed` that takes in two parameters - a string `secreteWord`, and a list of letters, `lettersGuessed`. This function returns a Boolean `True` if `secretWord` has been guessed (i.e. all the letters of `secretWord` are in `lettersGuessed`) and `False` otherwise.

Example:

```python
>>> secretWord = 'apple'
>>> lettersGuessed = ['e', 'i', 'k', 'p', 'r', 's']
>>> print(isWordGuessed(secretWord, lettersGuessed))
False
```

You may assume all letters in all variables are lowercase.

### Problem 2 - Getting the User's Guess

Next, implement the function `getGuessedWord` that takes in two parameters - a string, `secretWord`, and a list of letters, `lettersGuessed`. This function returns a string that is comprised of letters and underscores, based on what letters in `lettersGuessed` are in `secretWord`. This shouldn't be too different from `isWordGuessed`!

Example:

```python
>>> secretWord = 'apple'
>>> lettersGuessed = ['e', 'i', 'k', 'p', 'r', 's']
>>> print(getGussedWord(secretWord, lettersGuessed))
'_pp_e'
```

When inserting underscores into your string, it's a good idea to add at least a space after each one, so it's clear to the user how many unguessed letters are left in the string (compare the readability of `___` with `_ _ _`). This is called *usability* - it is very important, when programming, to consider the usability of your program. If users find your program difficult to understand or operate, they won't use it!

For this problem, you are free to use spacing in any way you wish.

You may assume all letters in all variables are lowercase.

### Problem 3 - Printing Out all Available Letters

Next, implement the function `getAvailableLetters` that takes in one parameter - a list of letters, `lettersGuessed`. This function returns a string that is comprised of lowercase English letters - all lowercase English letters that are **not** in `lettersGuessed`.

Example:

```python
>>> lettersGuessed = ['e', 'i', 'k', 'p', 'r', 's']
>>> print(getAvailableLetters(lettersGuessed))
>>> abcdfghjlmnoqtuvwxyz
```

Note that this function should return the letters in alphabetical order, as in the example above.

You may assume all letter are in lowercase.

**HINT:** You might consider using `string.ascii_lowercase`, which is a string comprised of all lowercase letters:

```python
>>> import string
>>> print(string.ascii_lowercase)
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

### Problem 4 - The Game

Now you will implement the function `hangman`, which takes one parameter - the `secretWord` the user is to guess. This starts up an interactive game of Hangman between the user and the computer. Be sure to take advantage of the three helper functions,`isWordGuessed`, `getGuessedWord` and `getAvailableLetters`, that you've defined in the previous part.

#### Hints:

* You should tart by noticing where we're using the provided functions (at the tope of `ps3_hangman.py`) to load the words and pick a random one. Note that the functions `loadWords` and `chooseWord` should only be used on your local machine, not in the tutor. When you enter your solution in the tutor, you only need to give your `handman` function.
* Consider using `lower()` to convert user input to lower case. For example

```
guess = 'A'
guessInLowerCase = guess.lower()
```

* Consider writing additional helper functions if you need them.
* There are four important pieces of information you may wish to store:
  1. `secretWord`: The word to guess
  2. `lettersGuessed`: The letters that have been guessed so far
  3. `mistakesMade`: The number of incorrect guesses made so far
  4. `availableLetters`: The letters that may still be guessed. Every time a player guesses a letter, the guessed letter must be removed

See the sample output of a successful game and losing game above.

Note that if you choose to use the helper functions `isWordGuessed` or `getAvailableLetters`, you don't need to paste your definitions in the box. We have supplied our implementations of these functions for your use in this part of the problem. If you use additional helper functions, you will need to paste those definitions here.

Your function should include calls to `input` to get the user's guess.
