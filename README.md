# hello-world
Just another learning repository to share with the world.

I'll be posting and sharing my learning progress through the [OSSU CS curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). I'll do my best to highlight my own work and give credit to others as I embark on this coding journey.

# How the work will be structured

The top level folders will be by OSSU sequence number and course code or short name. Within each folder there will be a readme.md or other .md file with notes or course details. 

# Progress
Progress of Course Work will be tracked on the below Trello board and completed courses will be listed in the table below.

| Category         | Course Name                                                   | Link                                                                          | Folder             | Status      |
