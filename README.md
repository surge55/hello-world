# hello-world
Just another learning repository to share with the world.

I'll be posting and sharing my learning progress through the [OSSU CS curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). I'll do my best to highlight my own work and give credit to others as I embark on this coding journey.

## How the work will be structured

The three top level folders will be by OSSU sequence number followed by course code.
