# Chapter 4 Notes
## Functions



`def` defines the function - doesn't actually run the function until you call it

Two kinds of functions in Python:

1) **built-in function** that are provided as part of Python - print(), input(), type(), float(), int() ...
2) **functions that we define ourselves** and then use



A **function** is some reusable code that takes ***argument(s)*** as input, does some computation and then returns a result or results

We call/invoke the **function** by using the function name, parentheses, and ***arguments*** in an expression. 



### Arguments

An **argument** is a value we pass into the function as its input when we call the function



### Return Values

Often a function will take its arguments, do some computation, and **return** a value to be used as the value of the function call in the ***calling expression***. The **return** keyword is used for this.
